This project evaluates the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations by comparing two Python implementations: one using Pandas and the other using NumPy. By measuring their runtime performance, the project aims to learn insights for optimizing simulation workflows in data science. 

The project findings reveal a significant difference in efficiency between the two approaches, with the NumPy-based method demonstrating substantially faster runtime. This comparison in the project demonstrated the importance of choosing appropriate libraries and techniques to streamline computational processes and enhance productivity in data science projects.
