This project evaluates the computational efficiency of Monte Carlo simulations by comparing two Python implementations: one using Pandas and the other using NumPy. By measuring their runtime performance, the project aims to provide insights for optimizing simulation workflows in data science. The findings reveal a significant difference in efficiency between the two approaches, with the NumPy-based method demonstrating substantially faster runtime. This comparison demonstrated the importance of choosing appropriate libraries and techniques to streamline computational processes and enhance productivity in data science projects.
